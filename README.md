# SimpleProgram

This simple cli Java program, where the user can set a number of random integers and assign each a probability of them to appear.

## Dependencies

The program is written in Java 18, although there is nothing complex, it will be better if you use the same version for certain correct behaviour of the program. 

Used IntelliJ as an IDE. 

## How to run

First you have to clone the repository. 

There are several ways to run the program. Two of them are:
- for Ubuntu (22.04) users, there are two scripts - *runProgram.sh* and *Tests.sh* which will execute the program in the respective behaviour.
- The old school way of going to the **bin** folder and running the program directly with java command. The user will be asked to choose and provide between two commands/parameters - run and test.
